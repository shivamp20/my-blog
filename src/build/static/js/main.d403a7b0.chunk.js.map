Leaving in a world where ninja nations reign, he aspires to become the most honored position of them all in his nation, the Hokage, and thus finally be recognized. What Naruto doesnt know, but soon find out is that the reason he is shunned out is due to having the Kyubi, a demonic fox-like beast sealed inside him, which threatened to destroy the village years ago. In his quest to achieve his dreams the troublemaking Naruto manages to become a genin (lower ninja) and along with Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno, is trained by Kakashi Hatake in order to grow as a ninja.`,\r\n      `The second part of the serie takes place over 2 years after the original, Sasuke having left the village, Naruto decides to do so as well in order to train. Being trained by Jiraiya (a legendary ninja), Naruto becomes a much more skilled ninja and returns to the village of Konoha. Shortly after this the search for Sasuke, and the conflict with the group of rouge ninjas Akatsuki begins. This eventually leads into great conflicts which pit Naruto and Sasuke against Pain and Itachi, the outcome of these fights weighing severely on events to come.`,\r\n      `Naruto as a verse is not extremely powerful, but packs quite a punch in it's own right. The verse is littered with lightning timers, and even the low tiers can boast City Block+ to Town level attack potency. It's God Tiers sit at Small Planet+ level, with the verse's absolute God Tier Kaguya, possessing an attack that is at the very least Planet+ (likely far higher though as it was capable of erasing a dimension large enough to contain a planet and it's orbiting satellite). The top tiers of the verse range from Country+ to Continent level, while it's high tiers sit at around Island+ level. Mid Tiers are Mountain level with various feats to back them up.`,\r\n    ],\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    name: 'dark-series',\r\n    title: 'Netflix Highly rated Dark Series',\r\n    content: [\r\n      `Dark is a German science fiction thriller family drama series created by Baran bo Odar and Jantje Friese. Set in the fictional small town of Winden, it revolves around four interconnected families haunted by their secrets, and contains elements of science fiction and fantasy.\r\n      The series is Netflix's first original German series. The first season, comprising 10 episodes, premiered on December 1, 2017. The second season, comprising 8 episodes, was released on June 21, 2019. The third and final season, comprising 8 episodes, premiered on June 27, 2020.`,\r\n      `When two children go missing in a small German town, its sinful past is exposed along with the double lives and fractured relationships that exist among four families as they search for the kids. The mystery-drama series introduces an intricate puzzle filled with twists that includes a web of curious characters, all of whom have a connection to the town's troubled history -- whether they know it or not. The story includes supernatural elements that tie back to the same town in 1986. \"Dark\" represents the first German original series produced for Netflix.`,\r\n      `Initially, Dark was an idea for a crime show they had written two years prior to being contacted by Netflix. They had another idea for a time travel feature film and they combined the two ideas.[5]\r\n\r\n      Having grown up in a small town themselves, the creators had a fascination with the subject of the darkness hiding behind closed doors in a small town. David Lynch's Twin Peaks, which deals with the same topic, shaped them in their teenage years.[4] They were also inspired by their childhoods in German small towns during the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, when release of radioactive materials spread fears of contamination.[6] Other influences are Stephen King and David Lynch`,\r\n    ],\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    name: 'eminem-god',\r\n    title: 'Slim Shady As a God',\r\n    content: [\r\n      `The Marshall Mathers LP is the third studio album by American rapper Eminem, released on May 23, 2000, by Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. The album was produced mostly by Dr. Dre and Eminem, along with The 45 King, the Bass Brothers, and Mel-Man. Recorded over a two-month period in several studios around Detroit, the album features more introspective lyricism, including Eminem's thoughts on his rise from rags to riches, the criticism of his music, and his estrangement from his family and wife. A transgressive work, it incorporates horrorcore and hardcore hip hop, while also featuring satirical songs. Featured appearances include Dido, RBX, Sticky Fingaz, Bizarre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Nate Dogg and D12.`,\r\n      `he Slim Shady LP turned Eminem from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity. The rapper, who had previously struggled to provide for his daughter Hailie, noted a drastic change in his lifestyle.[5] In June 1999, he married his girlfriend Kimberly Ann \"Kim\" Scott, the mother of Hailie, despite the fact that the song \"'97 Bonnie & Clyde\" from The Slim Shady LP contains references to killing her.[6] The rapper became uncomfortable with the level of fame he had achieved, and said, \"I don't trust nobody now because everybody I meet is meeting me as Eminem...I don't know if they are hanging with me 'cause they like me or because I'm a celebrity or because they think they can get something from me.\"[5] Eminem also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content. He was labeled as \"misogynist, a nihilist and an advocate of domestic violence\", and in an editorial, Billboard editor in chief Timothy White accused Eminem of \"making money by exploiting the world's misery\".[2]`,\r\n      `Considered both a horrorcore album and a hardcore hip hop album,[17][18] much of the album's first half was produced by Dr. Dre and Mel-Man, who employed their typical sparse, stripped-down beats, to put more focus on Eminem's vocals. The background music on the record employs \"liquid basslines, stuttering rhythms, slight sound effects, and spacious soundscapes\".[19] Bass Brothers and Eminem produced most of the second half, which ranges from the laid-back guitars of \"Marshall Mathers\" to the atmosphere of \"Amityville\". The only outside producer on the album was The 45 King, who sampled a verse from Dido's song \"Thank You\" for \"Stan\", while adding a slow bass line.`,\r\n    ],\r\n  },\r\n];\r\n\r\nexport default
